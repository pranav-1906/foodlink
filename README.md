##FoodLink : Fighting Hunger with Technology
# Project Overview
FoodLink AI is a web application designed to combat hunger by connecting restaurants, food donors, and community kitchens with NGOs and other organizations in need of food. It provides a simple, interactive platform for donors to list surplus food and for recipients to find and claim donations, leveraging a user-friendly dashboard to manage all activities.

# Features
Donor Dashboard: A dedicated dashboard for donors to view and manage their donations. Key features include:
- A "Food Share Card" to quickly offer new food items.
- A real-time list of available food items.
- A searchable history of all past food transactions.

Restaurant Dashboard: A specialized dashboard for restaurants to list and manage their contributions. It features:
- A form to add new food items for donation.
- Statistics on their total donations.
- A list of items they have made available, with different statuses like "Fresh," "New," or "Pending".

Interactive Landing Page: The main entry point to the application, providing an overview of the project's mission to fight hunger with technology. It includes distinct calls to action for both restaurants and NGOs to get started.
